## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Copy files

- Copy backend files to: `custom_components/cardwallet/`
- Copy frontend files (JS, libs) to: `www/cardwallet/`

> Home Assistant serves `www/` as `/local/`  
> So `www/cardwallet/qrcode.min.js` becomes available at `/local/cardwallet/qrcode.min.js`

üìö [More info on serving local files in HA](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/frontend/custom-ui/registering-resources)

### 2. Restart Home Assistant
After copying files and updating config, restart HA.

No restart is needed for `www/cardwallet/`, but you may need to clear your browser cache if changes don't appear.

### 3. Configure configuration.yaml
Add the following to your configuration.yaml:
```yaml
cardwallet:
```

#### Option B ‚Äì via `configuration.yaml`
